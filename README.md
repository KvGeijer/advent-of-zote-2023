# Advent of Zote

This is the home for my solutions to the 2023 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.

Theay are mainly wirtten in [Zote](https://github.com/kvgeijer/zote) which is my own scripting language with a strong emphasis on pipes. Zote compiles to stack-based bytecode such as Python, but is not that optimized, making it around 3x slower than Python. I only had to switch ty Python once when I needed the Z3 solver.
