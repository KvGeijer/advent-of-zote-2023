# Advent of Zote

This is the home for my solutions to the 2023 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge.

I will be solving them in [Zote](https://github.com/kvgeijer/zote) which is my own scripting language with a strong emphasis on pipes. Zote compiles to stack-based bytecode such as Python, but is not that optimized, making it arount 3c slower than Python. Due to this I might have to switch to Rust if some day really demands a brute force solution.
